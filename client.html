        <h2>Meet Bob.</h2>
        <h3>Bob is a 32-year-old former lumberjack who lost his right hand during an accident at the saw mill. He is no longer able to work as a lumberjack, and even the simplest of daily tasks have become difficult with only one hand. Bob is eager to regain his ability to swing his axe and complete tw connect with his family through technology. Solutions like sip-and-puff systems, voice-activated smart home controls, or eye-tracking devices for computer access could significantly enhance his ability to interact with his environment and communicate.
